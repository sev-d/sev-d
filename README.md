👋 Hi, I’m Severine Drin
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m currently pursuing a Master of Computing and Innovation at the University of Adelaide, and I’m passionate about applying my technical expertise to solve real-world problems, especially in data analysis, bioinformatics, and software development.

🌟 Background in Business:
Before moving into tech and bioinformatics, I gained experience in the business world, including managing 500+ clients and exceeding sales targets as a Sales Account Manager at ACTi Corporation in Taiwan. This background has given me strong interpersonal and communication skills, which I use to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams.
